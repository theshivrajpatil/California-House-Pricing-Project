# Why Are We Building This?
Gurgaon, a rapidly growing city in India, has seen a sharp rise in real estate development over the past decade. With its proximity to Delhi, booming IT hubs, and modern infrastructure, Gurgaon has become a major attraction for both homebuyers and investors. However, the real estate market here is highly dynamic and often difficult to assess without proper data-driven tools.

# We’re building a Gurgaon house price prediction model to help:

Understand how factors like location, size, number of rooms, and amenities affect property prices in Gurgaon.
Assist buyers in identifying fair prices based on historical trends.
Help sellers estimate an appropriate asking price.
Empower real estate agents and platforms to improve recommendations and negotiations.
# How Will We Build It?
While we don’t have access to a large, clean dataset of house prices in Gurgaon right now, we will use a well-known and cleaned dataset—the California housing dataset—as a proxy. This will allow us to build, test, and evaluate a working model with real-world variables like:

# Median income of the area
Proximity to the city center
Number of rooms
Latitude and longitude
Population density
We’ll treat this as a simulation: suppose the California data is Gurgaon data, and suppose we are building this model for a neighborhood where both you and I live or work nearby.

Once the model is developed and understood, we can later adapt the same approach to real Gurgaon data when available, using the same techniques and logic.

# Understanding the Problem
Before we build the model, we need to understand what kind of machine learning problem we are solving.

First, we’ll check if this is a supervised or unsupervised learning task. Since we have historical data with house prices (our target), and we want to predict the price of a house based on input features, this is a supervised learning problem.

Next, we observe that the model is predicting one continuous label — the price of a house — based on several input features. This makes it a univariate regression problem.
